        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        " - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of \"objects\". These objects represent real-world entities and contain both data (attributes) and behaviors (methods). OOP helps in organizing and structuring code in a way that promotes reusability, scalability, and maintainability. The four key principles of OOP are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        " - A class in Object-Oriented Programming is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects will possess. A class encapsulates data for the object and the functions to operate on that data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        " - An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity that combines data and behavior as defined in its class. Each object can have its own values for the attributes defined in the class and can use the methods associated with that class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        " - Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object to the outside world. It helps in reducing programming complexity.\n",
        "Encapsulation is the mechanism of wrapping the data (attributes) and the code (methods) that operates on the data into a single unit called a class. It restricts direct access to some components and helps in protecting the integrity of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        " - Dunder methods, short for \"double underscore\" methods, are special methods in Python whose names begin and end with double underscores. They are used to define custom behaviors for Python’s built-in operations and enable classes to integrate with Python’s language features, such as object initialization, string representation, arithmetic operations, and comparisons.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        " - Inheritance is an OOP concept that allows a class to acquire the properties and behaviors of another class. The class that inherits is called the subclass or derived class, while the class being inherited from is called the superclass or base class. Inheritance promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        " - Polymorphism refers to the ability of different classes to respond to the same function or method call in different ways. It allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common super type, enabling one interface to be used for multiple underlying forms or implementations.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        " - Encapsulation in Python is achieved by defining classes and using access specifiers to restrict access to variables and methods. By convention, single and double underscores are used to indicate protected and private members, respectively. Additionally, Python provides mechanisms like property decorators and getter/setter methods to manage access to class data.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        " - A constructor in Python is a special method that is automatically called when a new object of a class is created. Its primary purpose is to initialize the object’s attributes with default or specified values when the object is instantiated.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.  What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        " - Class methods are methods that are bound to the class and not the instance. They take the class itself as their first argument and are used to access or modify class-level data. Static methods, on the other hand, do not take the class or instance as their first argument and are used for utility functions that are related to the class but do not require access to class or instance data.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        " - Method overloading refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. While traditional method overloading is not directly supported in Python, similar behavior can be achieved using default arguments or variable-length argument lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        " - Method overriding is a feature in Object-Oriented Programming where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows the subclass to modify or extend the behavior of that method to suit its own needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        " - A property decorator in Python is used to define methods in a class that can be accessed like attributes. It is often used to control access to private attributes by providing getter, setter, and deleter methods in a clean and readable way.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        " - Polymorphism is important because it allows for flexibility and integration in code. It enables the same interface to be used for different types of objects, making it easier to develop scalable and maintainable code. It also promotes code reuse and simplifies the addition of new features.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        " - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be subclassed. It may contain abstract methods that have no implementation in the abstract class itself and must be implemented in any subclass. Abstract classes define a common interface for a group of related classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        " - The main advantages of Object-Oriented Programming include:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Modularity: Code is organized into separate objects or classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Reusability: Existing classes can be reused in new programs through inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Scalability: New functionality can be added with minimal changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Maintainability: Encapsulation makes code easier to understand and modify.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Security: Encapsulation and access restrictions protect data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        " - Class variables are shared across all instances of a class. They represent properties that are common to every object of that class.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Instance variables are unique to each object. They represent properties specific to a particular instance.\n",
        "\n",
        " Class variables are defined at the class level, while instance variables are typically defined inside the constructor or methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        " - Multiple inheritance is a feature in Python that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This enables a child class to combine functionalities of multiple base classes. While powerful, it must be used carefully to avoid confusion in method resolution and maintain readability.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python\n",
        " - The __str__ method is used to return a user-friendly string representation of an object. It is called when the object is printed or converted to a string.\n",
        "\n",
        " - The __repr__ method is intended to return a formal and unambiguous representation of the object, often useful for debugging. It should ideally return a string that could be used to recreate the object.\n",
        "\n",
        " Both methods help define how an object appears when printed or logged.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        " - The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent class. It is commonly used in inheritance scenarios to access and extend the behavior of the superclass. It allows a child class to invoke the implementation of a method from its parent class without hardcoding the parent class name, making the code more maintainable and robust.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        " - The __del__ method in Python is a special method known as a destructor. It is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed, typically when it goes out of scope or is deleted. The __del__ method can be used to perform cleanup activities like closing files or releasing resources before the object is removed from memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between staticmethod and classmethod in Python?\n",
        " - staticmethod defines a method that does not operate on an instance or class directly. It behaves like a regular function placed inside a class for organizational purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        " - classmethod defines a method that operates on the class itself, not on individual instances. It can access or modify class-level data using the cls parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        " The key difference lies in what they operate on: static methods operate independently, while class methods work with class-level context.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        " - In Python, polymorphism with inheritance allows a subclass to override a method defined in its superclass. When a method is called on an object, Python determines which version of the method to execute based on the actual type of the object, even if the object is referenced through a superclass. This dynamic method resolution allows different objects to behave differently while sharing a common interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        " - Method chaining in Python OOP is a programming technique where multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object in a single line. This is achieved by having each method return the object itself (self). It helps in writing concise and readable code, especially when performing multiple operations on an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        " - The __call__ method in Python allows an object to be called as if it were a function. When defined in a class, it enables instances of that class to behave like callable functions. This is useful in scenarios where function-like behavior is required from objects, such as in decorators or custom wrappers.\n",
